## About
This is a Spam Mail Detector project that uses machine learning to classify emails as either "Ham" (non-spam) or "Spam" (junk or malicious). It utilizes a TF-IDF vectorizer and a trained machine learning model to make predictions.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need Python and a few libraries installed. Follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iampraveens/https://github.com/iampraveens/Spam-Mail-Detector.git
```
2. Install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Prediction

streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage
- Launch the application using the instructions in the "Getting Started" section.
- Enter the email content you want to classify in the text area.
- Press "ctrl + enter" or click the "Predict" button.
- The application will classify the email as "Ham" or "Spam" and display the result.

## Dockerized Web App
You can also deploy the Spam Mail Detector web application using Docker. Build the Docker image and run the container:
```bash
docker build -t your_docker_username/cspam-mail-detector .
```
- To build a docker image.

```bash
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 your_docker_username/spam-mail-detector
```
- To run as a container.
